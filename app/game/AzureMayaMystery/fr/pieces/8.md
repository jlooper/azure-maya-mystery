# The Entryway

It's pitch black inside, and there's a musty smell. Using a flashlight from your backpack, you look around.

You see an empty room with various stones that have been dislodged from the walls. Some are cracked and broken. Clearly someone has been here before you.

To your left, you see a staircase leading down.
